Process Capability Calculator Application
===================

This Repo contains the ui.R and the server.R files of the Process Capability Calculator Application (CpkCal).

This application helps you calculate your process capability index by providing the USL, LSL, mean, and standard deviation as input variables. Additionally, it calculates the Defect Per Million Opportunity (DPMO) which is the expected number of defected items per million produced. This is represented by the red area under the curve outside the lines of specification limits.
